To get correct offsets for swerve modules:
    -Turn all swerve modules forward with the bevel gear on the left
    -Connect to the robot
    -Open Shuffleboard
    -The absolute encoder offset for that module is equal to the absolute angle value for that module in Shuffleboard
    -Make sure that:
        -The IDs for everything in the json files are correct and match with what phoenix tuner and Shuffleboard tell you
        -The appropriate values in shuffleboard change when you move the appropriate module around
        -The wheels are all pointed perfectly straight (I suggest using a metal beam to straighten them)
Once the offsets are good, play around with inversions to make sure everything is going where it should.
Also, make sure to adjust PIDs according to the YAGSL docs (docs.yagsl.com)
